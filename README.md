We work for clients Andrew Demetriou, PhD. student, and Cynthia Liem, PhD., to develop a collaborative platform and workflow for scientific publishing, for the duration of quarter 4. Our goal is to produce an open-source collaborative scientific publishing software product by translating the git workflow that is usually utilised by a narrow demographic (programmers, computer scientists) into a process that scientists from all domains will be able to use to publish articles and perform peer reviewing.
